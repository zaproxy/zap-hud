<H1>The HUD</H1>

The HUD is a completely new interface that brings information and functionality from ZAP into your browser.

</ul>

<H2>Command Line Options</H2>
The HUD works equally well with ZAP in desktop and daemon modes.<br>
As many people use ZAP in daemon mode for automated testing the HUD is disabled by default in this mode.<br>
The HUD add-on adds new ZAP command line options which enable the HUD in daemon mode and launch a browser 
preconfigured to proxy through ZAP and ignore certificate errors:
<ul>
<li>-hud : launch a browser with the HUD enabled, only needed if you don't want to specify a browser or url</li>
<li>-hudbrowser &lt;browser&gt; : the browser ZAP will use, either Firefox (the default) or Chrome</li>
<li>-hudurl &lt;url&gt; : the URL that will be opened in the browser, by default none</li>
</ul>
Any combination of these parameters will launch a browser with the HUD enabled.<br><br>

You can also enable the HUD in daemon mode without launching a browser using the ZAP command line option:
<pre>-config hud.enabledForDaemon=true</pre>

<H2>Getting Involved</H2>

ZAP is a community project and so we are always very keen to hear from anyone who'd like to contribute, 
just post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-hud">ZAP HUD Group</a>

<H2>Caveats</H2>

This is still early days for this add-on :)

Some known issues include:

<ul>
<li>Only a limited amount of ZAP functionality is available</li>
<li>We're still using Vue.js in dev mode so can't apply a suitably strong CSP</li>
<li>The JavaScript code needs to be properly formatted and linted</li>
<li>Firefox has been tested more than Chrome, but both should work</li>
<li>The code to support the HUD in multiple browser tabs is very new so might be buggy</li>
<li>In particular don't close the first tab on Firefox or the HUD will stop working</li>
<li>Documentation could, of course, be better</li>
</ul>
