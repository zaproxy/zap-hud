<H1>The HUD</H1>

The HUD is a completely new interface that brings information and functionality from ZAP into your browser.

<H2>Getting Involved</H2>

ZAP is a community project and so we are always very keen to hear from anyone who'd like to contribute, 
just post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop">ZAP Dev Group</a>

<H2>Caveats</H2>

This is definitely alpha quality :)

Some known issues include:

<ul>
<li>It's early days, so only a limited amount of ZAP functionality is available</li>
<li>We're still using Vue.js in dev mode so can't apply a suitably strong CSP</li>
<li>The JavaScript code needs to be properly formatted and linted</li>
<li>Firefox has been tested more than Chrome, but both should work</li>
<li>The code to support the HUD in multiple browser tabs is very new so might be buggy</li>
<li>In particular don't close the first tab on Firefox or the HUD will stop working</li>
<li>Documentation could, of course, be better</li>
</ul>
