	<H1>Options HUD screen</H1>

	<h2>Enable when using the ZAP Desktop</h2>
	
	When set the HUD will be injected into HTML responses when the ZAP Desktop is used. This defaults to true.

	<h2>Enable when using ZAP in daemon mode</h2>
	
	When set the HUD will be injected into HTML responses when ZAP is started in daemon or 'headless' mode. 
	This defaults to false as many people use ZAP for automation, injecting the HUD would not help and could cause
	existing tests to break.

	<h2>Show the HUD welcome screen when a browser is opened</h2>
	
	When set the HUD Welcome screen, which includes a link to the tutorial, will be shown whenever a browser that is proxying through ZAP is opened.
	The welcome screen includes an option to not show the screen again, if that is selected then this is the only
	way to make the welcome screen appear again.

	<h2>Enable the HUD only for URLs that are in scope</h2>
	
	If selected then only URLs flagged as 'in scope' in ZAP will have the HUD injected into them.
	The plan is to expose this option via the HUD, but until that time if the option is enabled then you will
	need to add URLs to the scope via the ZAP Desktop.

	<h2>Remove CSP from target pages</h2>
	
	The HUD will not currently work if a strong CSP policy is used in target web sites. 
	By default ZAP will strip off the CSP, turning this option off may well cause the HUD to break.

	<h2>Development mode</h2>
	
	If set then various options are set that can be useful when debugging the HUD, including:
	<UL>
	<li>Setting the client side debug level to DEBUG</li>
	<li>Sending the client side logging to the ZAP Output tab</li>
	<li>Adding the 'HUD Errors' tool which shows any errors logged</li>
	</UL>

	<h2>Base directory</h2>
	
	This should not be changed at this time.

	<h2>Allow unsafe evals</h2>
	
	This is currently required in order for the HUD to work. 
	In the future the plan is to only require this when actually developing the HUD.

	<h2>Skip tutorial tasks</h2>
	
	Setting this option allows you to view all of the tutorial pages without passing the tasks.

	<h2>Reset tutorial tasks</h2>
	
	Clicking on this button will reset the tasks so that you will be able to take them again.
