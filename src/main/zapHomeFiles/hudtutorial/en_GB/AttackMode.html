	<h1>Attack Mode</H1>
	The 'Attack Mode' <img src="flame-grey.png"> tool performs the same attacks as an Active Scan but works in a subtly different way.
	<p>
	Instead of attacking the URLs known at the time it is started, it attacks any URLs that are in scope as soon as they
	are discovered. It does not show any progress because it stays active with the <img src="flame.png"> icon until is is stopped.
	<p>
	This mode is especially useful for testing a sub section of a large site - when it is enabled it will only attack
	the in scope URLs that you visit as you explore them and will not attack any parts of the site that you do not use.
	So unlike the Active Scan, which you typically start after you have explored the site, it's usually better to enable the
	Attack Mode before you start exploring the site.
