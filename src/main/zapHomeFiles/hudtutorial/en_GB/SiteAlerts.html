	The issues that apply to any of the pages on the site you are browsing will be shown as 'Site Alerts', 
	which by default are shown on the right hand side. These will include all of the alerts on the current page
	you are viewing as well as the alerts on all of the other pages on the site.
	<p>
	The alerts are grouped by risk in the same way as Page Alerts:
	<ul>
	<li><img src="site-alerts-high.png"> High Level Site Alerts
	<li><img src="site-alerts-low.png"> Low  Level Site Alerts
	<li><img src="site-alerts-medium.png"> Medium Level Site Alerts
	<li><img src="site-alerts-informational.png"> Informational Level Site Alerts
	</ul>  
	As with Page Alerts you can click on any of the tools to see the list of alerts, the URLs that have each type of alert 
	and the full details for any specific alert.
