	When testing a site there are many times when it is useful to be able to change requests 'on the fly' - you can
	do this using the  <img src="break-off.png"> 'Break' tool.
	<p>
	The following form uses HTML5 to limit the values to between 1 and 100:
	<form action="Break" method="post"> 
	<table border="0">
		<tr>
			<td>Enter a number from 1 to 100:</td>
			<td><input type="number" id="number" name="number" min="1" max="100" value="1"></td>
			<td><input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" /> </td>
		<tr>
	</table>
	</form>
	<p>
	When you click the 'break' tool you will see that the button changes to <img src="break-on.png"> and this means
	that all requests to and from your browser will be intercepted by ZAP. 
	When you then submit the form (or navigate to another page) you will be shown a dialog that contains the request that has been sent by the browser.
	You can change any part of the request before it is submitted to the site, including the values set via the form, 
	and then select either:
	<ul>
	<li>Step: to submit this request and then break on the next request or response</li>
	<li>Continue: to submit this request and turn the 'break' tool off</li>
	<li>Drop: to prevent the request from being sent to the site or the response from being received by the browser</li>
	</ul>
