	<h2>Task</h2>
	A previous page has included a JavaScript page called Tutorial.js.<br>
	The key is in that file, but there are no alerts associated with it and its not been included by this page.
	However you will be able to see the request for the file in Sites tool, just make sure that you look under the 
	right site - your browser might have made requests to lots of other sites by now..
	<form action="Sites" method="post">
	<input type="hidden" name="anticsrf" value="<!-- CSRF -->"/>

			<td>Key:</td>

			<td><input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" /> </td>
