	<h1>Alert Notifications</H1>
	ZAP can raise alerts for a wide variety of potential security issues.
	<p>
	The first time that ZAP find a specific type of issue with a site it will show the name of the issue in a 
	notification that appears in the bottom right hand corner of your browser. 
	<p>
	Some alerts can apply to lots of pages on a site, so the HUD will only ever show you a notification the first
	time a specific alert is raised. 
	<p>
	You can click on the alert notification to see more information about that alert, including the request and response
	associated with it. Alert notifications are only shown for a short period of time, but don't worry if you don't click
	on one in time, the next 2 pages of this tutorial will explain how you can access them at any time.
