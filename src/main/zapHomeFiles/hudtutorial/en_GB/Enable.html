	<h1>Enable Fields</H1>
	This page has 3 fields on it. As you will see you can't type in the second or third fields:
	<form action="Enable" method="post">
	<table border=0>
		<tr>
			<td>You can type in this field:</td>
			<td><input type="text" id="field1"></input></td>
		<tr>
		<tr>
			<td>This field is disabled:</td>
			<td><input type="text" id="field2" name="field2" disabled value="Disabled" /></td>
		<tr>
		<tr>
			<td>This field is readonly:</td>
			<td><input type="text" id="field3" name="field3" readonly value="Readonly" /> </td>
		<tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td><input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" /> </td>
		<tr>
	</table>
	</form>
	However if you click on the <img src="show-off.png"> 'Show / Enable' tool then the icon will change to
	<img src="show-on.png"> and you will now be able to type in all of the fields. You can then try changing
	fields that the developers might have thought could not be changed. 
	Clicking on the 'Show / Enable' tool again will return the field to their previous states, 
	but the text you typed will still be in the fields.
	<p>
	Fields enabled by this tool will be outlined in blue so that you can easily identify them.
	<p>
	It is worth noting that some fields may still be disabled if they use JavaScript to prevent them from being modified,
	you will see how you can still change these values later in this tutorial.
