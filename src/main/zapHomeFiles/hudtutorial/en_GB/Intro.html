	The HUD is a completely new way to interact with ZAP.<br>
	It overlays security information on top of the application you are testing and allows you to access key ZAP features.<br>
	It is easier for people new to security to understand but it also allows experienced penetration testers to focus on the application they are testing.
	<p>
	By default the HUD is injected into all of the HTML pages proxied through the ZAP desktop. 
	You can turn it on and off easily using the <img src="radar.png"> button on the ZAP toolbar. 
	It is not injected by default into pages proxied through ZAP when it is running in headless/daemon mode as that could break unit tests. 
	This behaviour can be changed via the HUD options.
	<p> 
	This tutorial will take you through the HUD features and explain how you can use them.
