	The HUD is a completely new way to interact with ZAP.<br>
	It overlays security information on top of the application you are testing and allows you to access key ZAP features.<br>
	It is easier for people new to security to understand but it also allows experienced penetration testers to focus on the application they are testing.
	<p>
	This tutorial will take you through the HUD features and explain how you can use them.
