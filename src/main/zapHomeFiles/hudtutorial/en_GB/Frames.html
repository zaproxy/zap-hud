	<h1>The HUD Frames</H1>
	The HUD overlays a set of frames on top of the target application, which in this case is this tutorial.
	<p>
	You can see 2 of the HUD frames on the left and right hand sides of this page.
	These contain a set of tools that we will explain in this tutorial.
	<p>
	If you hover over any of the tools then you will see that they expand to show more information.
	<p>
	The tools are designed to take up as small amount of space as is practical, 
	but it is possible that they could still obscure information that you want to see
	on the target page.
	<p>
	If that happens then you can hide these 2 frames by clicking on the green HUD icon
	<img src="radar.png"> near the bottom right of this page. 
	<p>
	The icon will change to a grey colour <img src="radar-grey.png">  
	and the HUD side frames will stay hidden until you click on that button again, 
	even if you navigate to a new page.
