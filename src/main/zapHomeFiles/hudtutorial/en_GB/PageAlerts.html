	Potential security issues on the page you are viewing will be shown as 'Page Alerts', 
	which by default are shown on the left hand side. This allows you to just focus on the potential issues on
	your current page without being distracted by issues on other pages. 
	<p>
	Alerts have an associated risk, and all alerts of with the same level of risk are shown together:
	<ul>
	<li><img src="page-alerts-high.png"> High Level Page Alerts
	<li><img src="page-alerts-low.png"> Low  Level Page Alerts
	<li><img src="page-alerts-medium.png"> Medium Level Page Alerts
	<li><img src="page-alerts-informational.png"> Informational Level Page Alerts
	</ul>  
	The Page Alert tools show the number of alerts for each level of risk. You can click on any of them to
	see the list of alerts, the URLs that have each type of alert and the full details for any specific alert.
