	<h2>Task</h2>
	This page will have included a JavaScript page called History.js.<br>
	The key is in that file, but this time there are no alerts associated with it.
	However you will be able to see the request for the file in History panel once you have expanded it.
	<form action="History" method="post">
	<input type="hidden" name="anticsrf" value="<!-- CSRF -->"/>
	<table border=0>
		<tr>
			<td>Key:</td>
			<td><input type="key" id="key" name="key"></input></td>
			<td><input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" /> </td>
		<tr>
	</table>
	</form>
