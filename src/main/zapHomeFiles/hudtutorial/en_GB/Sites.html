	ZAP builds up a hierarchical site tree based on the URLs that your browser accesses.
	<p>
	The Sites tool <img src="world.png" alt="[globe]">, which by default is on the right-hand side, allows you to view 
	the sites tree for all of the URLs that ZAP is aware of. 
	Click on the '[ + ]' and '[ - ]' controls to expand and contract the branches.
	<p>
	You can also click on any of the URLs in the sites tree to see the request and response made for that URL.
