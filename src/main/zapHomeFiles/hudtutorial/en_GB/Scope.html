	<h1>Scope</H1>
	The Scope tool <img src="target-grey.png"> shows you whether the page your are viewing is 'in scope', 
	in other words if it is part of the site you are testing.
	<p>
	When you start using the HUD no pages will be in scope, so the icon will always be grey.
	To add or remove the current site from scope click on the scope tool.
	The scope icon will change to: <img src="target.png"> when you are viewing a URL that is in scope. 
	<p>
	The HUD will only allow you to use tools like the spider and active scanner on sites that are in scope.
	The scope tool also makes it easy to see when you navigate off your target site.
