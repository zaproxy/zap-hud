	<h2>Task</h2>
	A low level alert called "HUD Tutorial Site Alert" will be raised for a JavaScript file that this page includes once it has been passively scanned.<br>
	As the alert is not on this page you will not see it in the Page Alert tools, 
	but you will still see it in the <img src="site-alerts-low.png"> Low Level Site Alerts tool on the right hand side. 
	Once it has been raised you can obtain the key via that alert.
	<form action="SiteAlerts" method="post">
	<input type="hidden" name="anticsrf" value="<!-- CSRF -->"/>
	<table border=0>
		<tr>
			<td>Key:</td>
			<td><input type="key" id="key" name="key"></input></td>
			<td><input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" /> </td>
