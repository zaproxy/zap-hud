	You can resend and change requests that have previously been sent by your browser or ZAP.
	This applies to all of the requests you can see in the HUD, whether via the History tab, 
	the Sites tree or one of the alerts.
	<p>
	When you display a request you will see 2 options:
	<h2>Replay in Console</h2>
	This will submit the request, along with any of your changes, and show the response in the Response tab.
	This allows you to try different inputs and see how it affects the raw HTML.
	<h2>Replay in Browser</h2>
	This will submit the request, again along with any of your changes, but in this case the response will be 
	displayed in the browser as HTML. This works for POST requests as well as GET requests.
